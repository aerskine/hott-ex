HoTT Exercises
==============

Exercises from the HoTT book (http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/).

I have cheated a bit by using code from the HoTT-Agda (https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda) lib, chiefly
for the equational reasoning operator (all of the code in Base.agda is from there), but on the
whole I have tried to spell things out.

(One reason for not using HoTT-Agda lib directly is unexplained highlighting errors
involving certain terms over Nat)

Code that I have copied from HoTT-Agda is in Base.agda and FunExt.agda and is covered by the license LICENSE-HoTT-Agda.  My exercise solutions have comments which are copied from the book which is covered by [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
