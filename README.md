HoTT Exercises
==============

Exercises from the HoTT book (http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/).

I have cheated a bit by using the HoTT-Agda (https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda) lib, chiefly
for the equational reasoning operator (all of the code in Base.agda is from there), but on the
whole I have tried to spell things out.

(One reason for not using HoTT-Agda directly is unexplained highlighting errors
involving certain terms over Nat)
